*2017 - 2019*
:   **Software Development Engineering**
:   *Commercial Software Engineering, Microsoft, Redmond, WA*
    - Engaged with Azure customers, commercial partners and NGOs to prototype innovative solutions using early release Azure products, ML techniques from recent academic work and open source projects.
    - [Project Fizzyo](https://fizzyo.github.io/)
      + Largest Cystic Fibrosis physiotherapy clinical trial in the UK to date aiming to quantify the impact of physical activity and evaluate the role of gamification in airway clearence treatments.
      + In partnership with Great Ormond Street Hospital developed a data analysis pipeline for the breath pressure sensors attached to airways clearance devices as well as Fitbit activity trackers.
      + Quantified breath and physical activity patterns of the trial participants by processing and featurizing large amount of sensor waveform data.
      + Using unsupervised learning techniques identified physical and respiratory activity clusters correlating with clinical outcomes.
    - [Famine Early Action Mechanism](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/famine-early-action-mechanism)
      + Crisis alerting system that provides granular famine risk 6-12 month predictions, used by humanitarian aid institutions to preemptively allocate funds to communities at high risk.
      + Collaborated with World Bank Famine Prevention program to build an interpretability framework that quantifies the magnitude of the risk factors
      + Project under executive sponsorship of Microsoft Philanthropies.
    - Prototyped Reinforcement Learning solutions for industrial scenarios, in partnership with a commercial airline and a Formula 1 race team.
