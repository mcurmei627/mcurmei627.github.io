This work proposes a methodology for developing grounded dynamic preference models. We demonstrate this method with models that 
capture three classic effects from the psychology literature - Mere-Exposure, Operant Conditioning, and Hedonic Adaptation. 
We conduct simulation-based studies to show that the psychological models manifest distinct behaviors that can inform system design. 
Our study has two direct implications for dynamic user modeling in recommendation systems. 
First, the methodology we outline is broadly applicable for psychologically grounding dynamic preference models. 
It allows us to critique recent contributions based on their limited discussion of psychological foundation and their implausible predictions. 
Second, we discuss implications of dynamic preference models for recommendation systems evaluation and design. 
In an example, we show that engagement and diversity metrics may be unable to capture desirable recommendation system performance.
