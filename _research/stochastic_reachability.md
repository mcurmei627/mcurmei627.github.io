Access to digital content is often mediated by recommendations, which are primarily designed to
predict user preferences. We take an alternate
view in this work, exploring mechanisms which
determine the availability of content from the perspective of user agency. We introduce a notion
of reachability and show how it is determined by
preference scoring functions, item selection rules,
and user interface decisions. Simulated experiments illustrate these insights.
